# Local Workflow Configuration Override File
# 
# This file allows you to override any field from workflow.yaml for local development.
# Uncomment and modify any section below to override the corresponding values.
# 
# Only uncomment the specific fields (and their parent keys) that you want to override - you don't need to 
# uncomment entire sections if you only want to change one value.
#
# Example: To override just the speakeasyVersion, uncomment only that line:
# speakeasyVersion: "1.234.0"

# workflowVersion: 1.0.0
# speakeasyVersion: latest
# sources:
#     main:
